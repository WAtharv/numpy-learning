## Introduction

NumPy is a powerful Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. This repository serves as a collection of examples, exercises, and notes to help you learn NumPy from scratch or improve your existing skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package installer

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    This repository is structured to provide a clear and organized learning path for NumPy. You can navigate through the different directories, each focusing on specific NumPy concepts or functionalities.

> Add specific instructions on how to run your scripts or notebooks here. For example: `To run the basic array creation examples, navigate to the 'array_creation' directory and execute the 'basic_arrays.py' script.`

## Examples

Here are some examples of NumPy functionalities covered in this repository:

- **Array Creation:** Creating NumPy arrays from lists, tuples, or using built-in functions like `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`, etc.



- **Array Indexing and Slicing:** Accessing and modifying array elements using indexing and slicing techniques.

        arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    # Accessing elements
    print(arr[0])  # Output: 0
    print(arr[5])  # Output: 5

    # Slicing
    print(arr[2:5])  # Output: [2 3 4]
    print(arr[:3])   # Output: [0 1 2]
    print(arr[4:])   # Output: [4 5 6 7 8 9]
        arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

    # Element-wise addition
    print(arr1 + arr2)  # Output: [5 7 9]

    # Element-wise multiplication
    print(arr1 * arr2)  # Output: [ 4 10 18]

> Add more examples based on the content of your repository. Include code snippets and explanations for each example.  Link to specific files or directories in your repository for each example for better navigation.
